  swe_date_conversion():
  This function converts some date+time input {d,m,y,uttime}
  into the Julian day number tjd.
  The function checks that the input is a legal combination
  of dates; for illegal dates like 32 January 1993 it returns ERR
  but still converts the date correctly, i.e. like 1 Feb 1993.
  The function is usually used to convert user input of birth data
  into the Julian day number. Illegal dates should be notified to the user.

  Be aware that we always use astronomical year numbering for the years
  before Christ, not the historical year numbering.
  Astronomical years are done with negative numbers, historical
  years with indicators BC or BCE (before common era).
  Year 0 (astronomical)  	= 1 BC historical.
  year -1 (astronomical) 	= 2 BC
  etc.
  Many users of Astro programs do not know about this difference.

  Return: OK or ERR (for illegal date)

/*************** swe_julday ********************************************
 * This function returns the absolute Julian day number (JD)
 * for a given calendar date.
 * The arguments are a calendar date: day, month, year as integers,
 * hour as double with decimal fraction.
 * If gregflag = SE_GREG_CAL (1), Gregorian calendar is assumed,
 * if gregflag = SE_JUL_CAL (0),Julian calendar is assumed.
  
 The Julian day number is system of numbering all days continously
 within the time range of known human history. It should be familiar
 for every astrological or astronomical programmer. The time variable
 in astronomical theories is usually expressed in Julian days or
 Julian centuries (36525 days per century) relative to some start day;
 the start day is called 'the epoch'.
 The Julian day number is a double representing the number of
 days since JD = 0.0 on 1 Jan -4712, 12:00 noon.
 
 Midnight has always a JD with fraction .5, because traditionally
 the astronomical day started at noon. This was practical because
 then there was no change of date during a night at the telescope.
 From this comes also the fact the noon ephemerides were printed
 before midnight ephemerides were introduced early in the 20th century.
 
 NOTE: The Julian day number is named after the monk Julianus. It must
 not be confused with the Julian calendar system, which is named after
 Julius Cesar, the Roman politician who introduced this calendar.
 The Julian century is named after Cesar, i.e. a century in the Julian
 calendar. The 'gregorian' century has a variable length.

 Be aware the we always use astronomical year numbering for the years
 before Christ, not the historical year numbering.
 Astronomical years are done with negative numbers, historical
 years with indicators BC or BCE (before common era).
 Year 0 (astronomical)  	= 1 BC
 year -1 (astronomical) 	= 2 BC
 etc.

 (The parameter sequence m,d,y still indicates the US origin,
  be careful because the similar function date_conversion() uses
  other parameter sequence and also Astrodienst relative juldate.)
